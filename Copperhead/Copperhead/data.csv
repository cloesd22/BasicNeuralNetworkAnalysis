OneManFreakShow,"Ridge Racer Unbounded is a really fun street racing game and it's criminally low at $2.49. I've heard people have issues with the PC version but it always ran fine for me. 
Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed is an absolutely sublime kart racer, if you're into the Mario Kart games. 
Redout is a fun but really brutally difficult Wipeout-like racer. There is a steep learning curve, but it's enjoyable. 
The Dirt series is great - a bit closer to a sim than the games you mentioned, but not too much deeper than Forza Horizon. 
TrackMania 2 is awesome and weird. More of a time trials thing than actual head-to-head races, but a lot of fun nonetheless. If you buy a TM2 game, Stadium is the most active. 
Toybox Turbos is a really cheap Micro Machines-style arcade racer. A lot of fun in local multiplayer if that's your thing. 
Extreme-G 2 is a classic game. I have not played the recent PC port, but at $4 it may be worth a shot. 
Wreckfest is a demolition derby game that may appeal to you if you liked the crash modes in Burnout. 
Split/Second I've never actually played but a lot of people really love it.

Even better, you can use your level 50 to get some gear together for your new character and dump in the Veila warehouse and start off with nearly endgame gear. 
Then, when you get bored with that, you can play around with levelling up trade level. Or cooking.

Bizm0,"I really recommend Hollow Knight if you like exploration and platformer games.
It's not that focused on the platforming itself but there is so much to explore and the combat feels amazing as well.
The artstyle is one of the best I've seen in recent years (although I'm a bit of a sucker for cartoonish graphics with filters on them) and the soundtrack is beautiful.
However, this game is not for impatient people. It requires some backtracking unless following a guide (which I don't recommend due to the game feeling more awesome when going in blind and just doing your own thing). There are also bossfights which might take you multiple tries.
But if you like metroidvania games, this game is, in my opinion, a must have.
Edit: There are also lots of unlockables which you can switch between to suit your playstyle the best. These range from abilities to upgrades to better platforming capabilities.

mekranil,"I really liked Mankind Divided. It has great gameplay, satisfying combat and visuals, multiple ways to play through levels with either stealth, lethal/non lethal, guns blazing, hacking or pure power and the levels are well designed with many hidden paths around and secret paths to find depending on what augments you invest into. I also really liked the story and its Cyberpunk-esque world and AFAIK the main complaint is that the story abruptly ends when you feel like the final act is coming. Which is a valid complaint,but up until that point I've been really enjoying it. And for this price tag it's definitely worth it. I got about 40 hours from the game and I'm playing through the DLC right now, which is nice value for the discounted price right now (but definitely not essential, only if you like what you see in the game-it's more of the same.) Also ignore any of the microtransactions, you get enough of everything in the game, they're just useless.
XCOM 2 is amazing. If you like turn-based games you'll love it. Very few games have made me care about my virtual team more than this game.

SirThinkzALot,"So you go around finding slimes and maintaining your ranch that they will live on. You have to feed each slime the proper diet they require which means you're also now raising chickens and growing produce. You collect the ""plorts"" the slimes produce and sell them so you can keep upgrading the ranch.  You also want to explore the island which is fun but eventually feeding the slimes, collecting chickens, fruits and veggies, collecting and selling plorts starts to take up all your time and is the reason why my SO and I stopped playing. The first several hours are fun though but I can't recommend the first eight hours or so at that price. But that's just my experience and opinion of course.

Dredgen_Rin,"I got it a sale or two ago and have about 15 hours put into it. The only thing I've played like it would be Stardew Valley, and like that game you spend your time exploring, collecting and managing resources. There aren't any seasons though so you won't have to min max when it comes to what kind of slimes do you want, you basically experiment and go at your own pace.
Basically you are a frontiersperson on some weird planet full of adorable slimes. You explore the different areas available and round up the particular slimes you want. Feed them and they produce different things depending on their type. You can have them eat a different slime's produce and they take on the properties of that other slime. You can upgrade your ranch and equipment, allowing you to house more exotic slimes that produce more valuable goods and so on.
That's the gist of it, I thought it was fun for those 15 hours at least. Not sure how many more I'll put in but I got my money's worth. A game for when you really want to take it easy imo.

Hollow Knight is one of my favorite games of this year. Its a Metroidvania so expect a lot of exploration and some challenging combat, and honestly the music and atmosphere alone are worth it.
Fallout 4 is by all means a good game, I just wouldn't say it's a good Fallout Game (if that makes sense). A lot of the dark humor and personality of the world is lost with the new chat system, but the improvements in gunplay, power armor, and plotline make it a very solid rpg.
Tomb Raider is 10/10 i 100% the first one and I'm close to beating the second. They give actual purpose to hunting and crafting in this one which is a lot of fun since so much of the first perk tree focuses on it. The lack of multiplayer is a bit disappointing though, i really enjoyed the first game's, as flawed as it was 
Edit: Just thought I'd add that you might want to start with Dark Souls 1! It's aged very well, and most everything you learn there will carry over into Dark Souls 3. Dark Souls 2 is a bit of a different story (I recommend the Scholar of the First Sin edition of DS2 if you are going to play it at all) you will get frustrated a lot at first, but id still give it a try.
