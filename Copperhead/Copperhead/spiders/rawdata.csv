Something reminiscent of the old NFS Underground games, Most Wanted (2005), Burnout, Forza Horizon, etc. Any suggestions?,Also, opinions on Black Desert Online?,If you're willing to replay an ""old"" game, what about Burnout Paradise ? It's 2.50€ right now.,+1 for burnout paradise. By far the most fun I've had playing a racing game. ,+2 for burnout paradise. Probably the best arcade style racing game to date. Awesome to play if you can get friends on. And just driving around Paradise City smashing billboards by yourself is great. Spent three hours just driving sandbox in my ""El Camino"" on Friday. That's not even including time I spent with other parts of the game. Keep in mind, if customization is your thing, this game doesn't have much to offer. If you only care about the awesome driving. This game is 100% for you. If you want decent racing and good customization Midnight Club LA is good. ,Edit: typos. ,Driver San Francisco isn't 100% a racing game in the way of those other ones but it's still really great,Ridge Racer Unbounded is a really fun street racing game and it's criminally low at $2.49. I've heard people have issues with the PC version but it always ran fine for me. ,Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed is an absolutely sublime kart racer, if you're into the Mario Kart games. ,Redout is a fun but really brutally difficult Wipeout-like racer. There is a steep learning curve, but it's enjoyable. ,The Dirt series is great - a bit closer to a sim than the games you mentioned, but not too much deeper than Forza Horizon. ,TrackMania 2 is awesome and weird. More of a time trials thing than actual head-to-head races, but a lot of fun nonetheless. If you buy a TM2 game, Stadium is the most active. ,Toybox Turbos is a really cheap Micro Machines-style arcade racer. A lot of fun in local multiplayer if that's your thing. ,Extreme-G 2 is a classic game. I have not played the recent PC port, but at $4 it may be worth a shot. ,Wreckfest is a demolition derby game that may appeal to you if you liked the crash modes in Burnout. ,Split/Second I've never actually played but a lot of people really love it. ,Hopefully these are some good suggestions for you!,I remember playing the original TrackMania a while back and one of the Dirt games.

The game looks pretty damn good as is, but there's also some high res texture packs out there to spiffy it up if you so choose. Even with the base game though you'll have a blast, it is an incredible game.,Do I buy just half life 2 or do I buy any and all of the extras?

I have a copy to give. ,Nah, it's its own self-contained piece of the story, and the only proper 'full' and 'modern' game. Ep 1 and 2 are also 'modern', but you'd be hard-pressed to get more than 5-7 hours out of each as they're episodic content, whereas HL2 will probably take at least around 20-25 hours to play through.,I definitely started with HL2 and later went back to play HL1.  I'd almost recommend this, because I think a large part of why I was able to get through the somewhat-dated first game is because I was so hooked from the second.,If you want a modern Half Life 1, try playing Black Mesa which is the current remastered Half Life 1 version using the latest Source engine,  with the final Xen section(said to be modified to have a better ending) supposed to be finished by December. ,Hmmm.... have still not played the Half life games.  I'm not so young either, just always thought they were multiplayer games.
So should I start with Half life one or can I go straight to 2?  Also, what's with the episodes, or are they just multiplayer add-ons?,You can easily jump right into HL2 and have a great time. Personally I have never played HL1 and I felt like HL2 was just fine on its own. The episodes are continuations off the end of HL2. The order is HL2, then Episode 1, then Episode 2. They are all single player games, no internet connection needed or anything like that.,FTL is one of the best games I have ever played. It was such a pleasant surprise. ",200

So far I'm looking at these: ,-Slime Rancher (would love to hear thoughts on this game),-Cat Goes Fishing,-Bejeweled 3 (duh),-Hollow Knight (I know it's hard, but I loved Ori),Slime Rancher was fun for a while but wears thin, the actual content isn't really there. Cat Goes Fishing is surprisingly great, I'd highly recommend it. Imo Bejeweled has been surpassed many times over, you'd be better off with the more modern (mostly mobile) games.

Nonetheless it's a fun experience with a lot of stuff to poke around with after the Glass Desert update that just came out.,Overcooked and Cook Serve Delicious.,I'd hardly call overcooked relaxing, haha.,Also wouldn't recommend playing if you don't have people to couch co-op with. ,I really recommend Hollow Knight if you like exploration and platformer games.,It's not that focused on the platforming itself but there is so much to explore and the combat feels amazing as well.,The artstyle is one of the best I've seen in recent years (although I'm a bit of a sucker for cartoonish graphics with filters on them) and the soundtrack is beautiful.,However, this game is not for impatient people. It requires some backtracking unless following a guide (which I don't recommend due to the game feeling more awesome when going in blind and just doing your own thing). There are also bossfights which might take you multiple tries.,But if you like metroidvania games, this game is, in my opinion, a must have.,Edit: There are also lots of unlockables which you can switch between to suit your playstyle the best.

Nowhere near as labyrinthine as some games in the genre. Also I'd recommend playing on hard because it actually increases the enemy count and placement. I got through it in about five hours on that setting., -50% €1.49,This game is pretty simple. You fall and you shoot things. It's a lot more satisfying that it sounds., -75% €3.74,Open world rogue-lite. It's incredibly punishing but it's rewarding to figure this game out. It has a lot going on but it's great when it all starts to make sense. The UI is the biggest barrier to entry. Also don't take off the talisman., -50% €9.99,It's a 4X, mixed with a card game, mixed some rogue-lite stuff, and it has Slavic myths thrown in on top of it.

If you like time trials and repeating levels until you get them perfect then this is for you. Like I said it's not about bullshit level design but it's a really hard game to master. Incredibly pretty soundtrack on this one., -60% €3.59,It's hard for me to describe this without making it sound like complete shit., -80% €1.99,If first person fist fighting and unique art direction sound good to you then this is your game., -75% €4.99,Over the top Platinum Japanese action bullshit.

NMS is ,'s little brother with fetal alcohol syndrome who was dropped on his head as a baby., is brilliant. Still in Early Access, but it's got more to do than NMS does. It's a survival/creative game, with a heavy focus on creative. It's got an offline singleplayer mode. To me, it feels like the next iteration of Minecraft if Minecraft went to space. It's got bugs, quirks, and shortcomings, but has enough to keep me entertained. You can build your own vessel, pop a warp drive in it, and go zipping around the cosmos showing off your creation, or download a blueprint for one that someone else put on the Steam Workshop, gather the resources, and show off your fancy new UNSC frigate or Heron from , or even a scale model of the Death Star.",20

"Neil_Patrick,KillMeAtTheEnd,BugbearsRUs","I hear a lot of good things about Slime Rancher. Can someone explain to me what it is all about?  What does it compare to?,So you go around finding slimes and maintaining your ranch that they will live on. You have to feed each slime the proper diet they require which means you're also now raising chickens and growing produce. You collect the ""plorts"" the slimes produce and sell them so you can keep upgrading the ranch.  You also want to explore the island which is fun but eventually feeding the slimes, collecting chickens, fruits and veggies, collecting and selling plorts starts to take up all your time and is the reason why my SO and I stopped playing. The first several hours are fun though but I can't recommend the first eight hours or so at that price. But that's just my experience and opinion of course. ,I got it a sale or two ago and have about 15 hours put into it. The only thing I've played like it would be Stardew Valley, and like that game you spend your time exploring, collecting and managing resources. There aren't any seasons though so you won't have to min max when it comes to what kind of slimes do you want, you basically experiment and go at your own pace.,Basically you are a frontiersperson on some weird planet full of adorable slimes. You explore the different areas available and round up the particular slimes you want. Feed them and they produce different things depending on their type. You can have them eat a different slime's produce and they take on the properties of that other slime. You can upgrade your ranch and equipment, allowing you to house more exotic slimes that produce more valuable goods and so on.,That's the gist of it, I thought it was fun for those 15 hours at least. Not sure how many more I'll put in but I got my money's worth. A game for when you really want to take it easy imo.",9

It's fun ad the open world is massive (although Fallout 3 seems better for me yet for the plot - but I'm just started the game, I may change my mind then)  ,: Just for the hype, I'm not even into FPS games and may request a refund (Overwatch got me and I don't know why);  ,: I don't know what it is, but everybody here recommended so... why not?  ,: I don't know Civ5 but the experience from Beyond Earth and Rising Tide were enough.
