Basics behind the project was to import data on a reddit page all comments, usernames, and votes.
The scraper was succesful at this, however opening up the "load more comments" sections requires javascript manipulation that the scraper doesnt address.
In the future using a reddit python suite to achieve the scraping makes it easier. (API called praw)

The data is passed and manually edited a bit in the CSV (Empty lines as a result of anaconda on windows are deleted, and upvotes are turned into a value of 1 or 0 based of if upvote
are greater than average number).

This is a bit for future optimization.

The data then is put into the neural network that implements a basic classifier to fidn a relationship between variables and wehther upvotes are greater than average.
The neurla network was not able to find too strong of a relationship, only approaching 50-60% accuracy with a wide variance.

Future testing might be to confirm if the system works for a simple XOR gate and do a bit more work on validating our methodology.
